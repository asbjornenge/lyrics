Weaping will bury bodys,

waping can make you drown, and your weaping by the pound.

Weaping is for the poor and the wicked,

But I will be there for yah,

handle and care for yah, now...
                         C
When your close to the ground.

Searching never helped nobody,
find what they needed most, only bought them farther from the coast,
Searching will make you restless,
make you never settle down, bring you close to the ground.

But I will be here for yah,
handle and care for yah, through the sound.
Since you are now close to the ground.

My friend I will tell you,
you know I love you well, theres no escpaing hell.
My friend you have a strong back,
someday you'll be crowned, somewhere far from the ground.

But I will be here for yah,
handle and care for yah, through the sound.  
Since you are now close to the ground.

Grip steady on the main mast, (ei eller aen mast eller.no)
I will take the wheel (roret), I'll make you this here deal.
If you stear steady through this storm,
when we come around, you will not even feel the ground.

And I will be here for yah,
handle and care for yah, through the sound.
if you ever again come around.
