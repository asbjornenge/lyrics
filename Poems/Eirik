Childhood horses(heroes?), childhood friend,
time and wine (entwined?) will echoes bend,
a rope, a roof, a garage blend,
a broken body in a ... lend?.

I was him before,


If he can, I can, I know.
I was him before.
But I will not, nor will I rot.
I have not the need.

Childhood hands, on plastic seats,
buses break and rip my sleep.
