You were born, child of a 
thunder storm, wild winds blew

You danced and knew, blossomed in
winter, time flew, while reaching for

A places that fell, fade with your
your memory of all we used to call

...home.

You undress the world, with eyes
I wish I could use, to put faith in my

Simple soul, for me it all is
falling from hope, hoping that

Time it will tell, stories of us,
and when all else fell, ...

...know.
