Lonely stoner
=============

Two young yawning yellow pilgims poundig on my door,
with carried cases from far places, trying to sell me more.
But I already got to much of everything I'll ever need,
its just how I know it, this is how the world was put before my feet.

A triple trifle trilogy of totallitarian tounges,
who came rambling through my funeral saying I was too young.
To end up in this disposition disembled from a three tun truck,
I'd be better of if I came with them, theyd pin my luck.

et vers til?

I'm just a lonely rambler,
trying to get this world,
just a lonely lover,
trying to get my girl,
just a lonely stoner,
trying to find my house..
in the middle of the night..
for wich I lost my keys...
when I ran from the police...

Two sad silly silent faces stared back from my bathroom mirror,
one said I was seasick, while the other pointed at the door.
In where every mistery lies lingering, lingering.
In where every mistery lies lingering, for a fading fool,
Where one must trust and one must open up on a pallid stool.

I'm just a lonely rambler,
trying to get this world,
just a lonely lover,
trying to get my girl,
just a lonely stoner,
trying to find my house..
in the middle of the night..
for wich I lost my keys...
when I ran from the police...
