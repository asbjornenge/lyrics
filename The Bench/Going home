Going home
==========

Stuck, behing the curtains and the window glass,
dead, as a telephone.
Too, much of everything is not enough,
to sway my swinging mind.

Burnt, by the bayonettes of modern man,
choaked, in his million lairs.
Tired, of information running through my head,
need, a simple word.

Thats why I'm going, where its snowing...
I'm going home.

Crushed, beneath the pinnacle of poetry,
dead, as the cavalier
for, the pennetentiary of silent songs,
when, I didn't find you there.

Love, it is nothing but a forfit dream,
of, your piercing stair,
I, still have the picture that you drew for me,
you, think I'm weird.

Thats why I'm going, where its snowing... 
I'm going home.
