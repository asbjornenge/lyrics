Tell you what Im gonna do today,
Im gonna hop out of my hole.
shoot a shot of sunshine,
(rainbow)radiate my soul.

and all these broken bridges and all my burning toughts,
I will outrun, when these clouds are gone.

and the pile of perky prophets washing out my thoughts,
I will outrun, when these clouds are gone.

and all these dark materials sneaking in my thoughts,
are gonna run, cause the clouds are gone.

cause I am sick and tired of turning everyone,
into stone, the clouds are gone.


steal a bowl of sunshine,
to sprinkle on my soul.
gather up some friends of mine,

Tell you what Im gonna say today,
Im gonna say I say your wrong,
all your raging rivers
(cant you see your mighty highway)
ended up a billabong,
take a look around you son there aint nowhere to run,
your come undone when the coulds are done.

Im stand up on my high heals,

Tell you what Im gonna hear today,


Tell you what Im gonna play today,
Im gonna play you this here song,
play it until the break of day,
until all your fears are gone.
