The mood to be in,
dancing on a limb,
a skidmark on your shin,
wount bring you down or out,

...and everything you think you know,

is true,
me and you,
the silent crew,
holding hands, no demands,

...and everything you think you are,

is right,
a bird in flight,
up all night,
diving deep in your eyes,

...and everything you think you saw,

is gone,
nothings wrong,
