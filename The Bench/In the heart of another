In the heart of another
==

I always thought that you could cause happiness,
in the heart of another.
I never knew about the sorrow and strife,
in the life of my brother.

How could I, know the reason why?
How can I, understand?
How could I, know the reason,
There is flowers in your hand.

I always thought there was a curve in the room,
bending light in my direction.
I never knew about my shadow,
absorbing your reflection.

How could I, know the reason why?
How can I, understand?
How could I, know the reason,
There is flowers in your hand.

But I learn to love, the fluxiating sea,
the wildness of winter.
Through the trails of this everchanging trend,
chaos became a friend.
