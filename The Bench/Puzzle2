Ain't that the night again,
throwin' your picture on the wall.
I hardly even notice,
I haven't paid my attention for so long.

Theres been a strike in here for better gear,
but nothing ever seems to pay off,
Even the hauled out corpses in my clock,
are out of time.

The fingernailed laidy who broke my window,
lost a game of lickor to a crow.
My only friend got lost coming home,
never saw the ambulance in his fist before the flood.

Ain't no lonely footprints in the snow,
even the limping rat in a race has somewhere to crawl.
Its just me and harlequin runnig towards the sound,
of robert johnsons picking something he can't quite recall.

Ref:

Who knows something, I don't know.
Can you tell me, can't be sure.
The truth is a infinate/transparent mirror, i don't know more.

I'm just stuck in this foreign land with a piece of puzzle in my hand.
