Mr milkman and his mustash are wrestling on the floor
With the burlesque baby beggar banging on my neighbours door.
In a coaltrain leading over my tears from the war,
Up my broken ladder and down your less is more.

Please, don't arrest me.

The intrusion of illusion fell like a mighty twin, on my hudlum  
harbour, the one with the rain under her skin.
Shes dancing with my rusty mind on the strings of a violin.
Into the intercicion from where it all begins.
( To(wards?) the entwined isolation from here it all begins? )

Please don't arrest me.
