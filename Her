Leucanthemum vulgare
Stolen Mrs Marguerite
( Loves me, loves me not, loves me. )
--

When your with her that you had to steal,
and nobody could understand, why, and how you made it happen,
and she smiles and knows and spins and floats,
and the line between you is short and straight without curves or boats.

Oxeye daisy, take what you deserve,
does she love me, or does she not.
I believe she does.

With her pregnant eyes that glow green emeralds,
her hair that spiras down a fragile neck like ink reaching
for the breath of words to decorate, but she knows they will only disrupt
the beauty that falls in the realm of two rhythmic rhymes.

Oxeye daisy,
does she love me, or does she not.
She does.

And her mothers faithful christian seal,
though broken, the proud steel is passed with the passing time.
And her fathers kindness is a blanket below, that we all know,
but quetly let go so it will stay that way evermore.

Oxeye daisy,
does she love me, or does she not.
She does.
