Making music is creation, culture, craftsmanship, self exploration.
Playing live is entertainment.

The crazy squid

My #1 dogma:
==
Never think you know anything for sure, cause you don't.

All things at its source are too complex ( and they grow more complex the more you study them )
have too many implications and sides for the human mind to grasp, 
The more you study something, the more questions arise.

This is also the reason for anarchy.

You must play with fire in order to learn.
