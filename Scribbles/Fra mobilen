Damien little shun like a riddle, thought that the sun was ...

When I die I don't wanna be touched

Tidens tann og vind og vann

But in the shade of the stage, the dramatic dance of ...

But crossed in the creed, lies the laisure of humanity

Birds of kindred feather, Kin Lore, Mouth of Munin, Eye of fire, White Raven, Wirefall

My mind is filled with many memories. 
I remember when your grandpa died and you stood all alone,
I remember how he used to be your only sense of home,
I remember your mothers nervouse smile and your fathers thrembling hands,
I remember when we just had met and you were scared to sing a song,
you tried to wash my clothes but you managed to get it wrong,
I remember I was Dylan and you my lady sad, in the lowlands where we used to play...
I remember how you chased me down when .. ( I tried to run away )
I remember how I burned that letter..
I love you because you are my sugarcane, my umbrella in a world of rain.
And I love you until the end of this world, cause you were my girl.

A chaos of meaningless phrases

Yesterday, different things fall away like yesterday

Kvinnelig opera-stemme i bakgrunnen av prog delen av Komazein
Kanskje mannlig på slide biten?

A tragic mix of magic tricks

Hundre ting å ingen påse

Her grey skin as pure as ash,
her silver straight spin,
moves my mind,
like smoking hasj.

on some kind of uncomplicated cloud

Born inbetween the strings of coviellos mandolin

What comes around it might break you down

The hungover nuns

All the shit that I do, I usually do just to see if I can

Up and down, its the way it goes round and round

Wisdom of the slave

I battle myself in sickness and wealth,
on a one legged carrige of treason,
I battle myself and the books on my shelf...

If I could change the world, I woudn't change a thing
( I don't dare change world, I'd probably get it all wrong )
