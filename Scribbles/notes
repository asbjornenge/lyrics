Stories / Presentations
==
Just write down some weird short stories/presentations for each song,
wich either directly or abstract concerns the theme of the song...
If there could be a "rød tråd" that would be awesome, but don't struggle too much with that.
Try to make it clever...

Komazein
--
Have you ever had that feelin', when your so sure of what something means, and suddenly
get a piece of information that turns it all on its head?
Thats what Komazein is all about... 
To reveal, to reveal a piece of information previously hidden that can turn your world up side down.

( An wether you like it or not, almost everything you
  think you know can be turned on its head by such a piece of information.
  And theres nothing you can do but to except it... )


Thomas Tiller
--
Follow your dream people say.
Well if theres one thing I've learned so far in this life is that nothing goes according
to plan, so the one thing you can be sure of is that if you follow you dream, thats the one
place your not going to end up ( one thing your not going to have ).


Harlequins dream
--
But I'm not saying you should not have a dream, just don't expect it to come true.
Like Thomas, another friend of mine, called Harlequin had a dream once... Litt om drømmen hans...
But Harlequin is a shapeshifter and change dreams numerous times a day, wich I guess
is the more sensible thing to do?


Raindrops
--
But what about love? Says the crazy squid.
Love and only love, it make the world go round.
One of those weird things you can't look for it, it can't be found, it just comes around.
Some other examples follow...


End

End with a piece of information that dissolves everything before this...

Get Carri to play the tambourine like on the recordings...
