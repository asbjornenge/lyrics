There's a woman in the courtyard walking,
a wobble in the crowd.
Somehow she ends up talking to the guy wrapped up in rhymes.

Silversilhuettes are swimmin all along her spine.
"something" rolling out of my mind. ( you know that it ain't mine? )

There a crow in the courtyard crying,
canned in cobble stone.
Somehow it ends up flying into the 
Black feather comes falling...
...
Something tells me 

Siste vers:
--
Theres a woman in the cortyard walkin ( lying? - ...after the whole ordeal above... kanskje har de v√¶rt sammen? )
disappering in the crowd,
falling in the crowd,
following the crowd,
somehow she ends up talking to the guy wrapped up in sounds.

Silversilhuettes of silence are messing up my rhymes.
