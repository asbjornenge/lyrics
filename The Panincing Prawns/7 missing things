Title: life worth living?
--

The world is filled with 7 missing things,
and you know the one who finds them all.

He will be forgiven,
lead a life worth living,
he will have you naked and ware your ring.

The heart is filled with seven different strings,
and youve got a swing them all to make her sing.

To lead a life worth living
to sing a sing worth giving,
to take her hand and let her come your way.

A life is filled with many heavy things,
each weighs as much as luck can bring.

to lead a life worth living,
you've got to be forgiving.
you've gotta take each moment as they come.
