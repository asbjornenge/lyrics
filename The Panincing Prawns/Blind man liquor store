Blind man, liqour-store,
brown suits, diamond shores.
blue jeans and neon lights too.

Old dog, sandy shores
mobile phones and tennis balls
mohitoes with charlie and you.

Folding out to fly,
the dream was touching the eye.

Blue veign, Curt Kobain,
skateboard, computer game.
Dress up, looking cool.

Conchords, greedy liars.
Credit cards and burnt out tires.
Skippy, the Cangaroo.

Hungry brick in the sky,
piercing the truth with a lie.










touching the tip of the lie.
