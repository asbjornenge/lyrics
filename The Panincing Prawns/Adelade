Ohhh.. Intro..

== 1 bit == 

When I was born into this world,
we could not afford a name.
We would spend our days counting,
on the leaves to catch the rain.
On our knees when we were praying,
for the seasons not to change.

And I would cup my hands together,
for the prophets of the curb.
With my arms stretched out like branches,
for the music in their words,
so confusing to be heard.
though amusing to the birds.

...of Adalade.

Bridge thing...

== 2nd bit ==

I couldnt taste my rasions,
I couldnt trace back my roots.
It's not the fakest emotion,
it's not like we all face the truth.

It's not like we were lost,
It's just that we couldnt be found,
It's not like I'd bring home the bacon,
like I never do nothing profound.
But love was certenly abound
when the leaves finally hit the ground.

..In Adelade.
