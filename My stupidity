My love is in the ocean,
my love is out at sea,
my love is in the ocean cause of me.

Walkin along the beach one day, looking fine and feeling gay.
Not the homosexual kind of gay, the happy kind og gay.
And all of a sudden I saw this beautiful thing standing there all alone
looking out at the endless ocean.
And I just knew, I knew that she was the one I had been looking and she was probably
standing there looking for me, so I got my chin up and my courage out of my pocket and I said:

( we would get a house by the sea and a dog and... or maybe an apartment or something,
 or at least we'd date for a while and see where it goes, or at least I thought
 there was a hug in it for me... )

I dont want any one but you,
I dont want any one but you,
I dont want any one but you,
all I want is you.

And she slowly turned around and said with this sweet little voice...

I dont want any one like you,
I dont want any one like you,
I dont want any one like you,
and I dont want you.

That kind of set me back... But I knew there had to be some kind of misunderstanding, you see. Cause
she was the one for me, and that was how it was.
So I put my head on the side, and a solitairy stare in my eye and said:

If I cant have you,
if I cant have you,
if I cant have you,
Ill through my loving to the deep blue...

Sea, eyeyeyyyyyy eyeyyyyy eyeyeyyyyy eyeyyy...

So my love is in the ocean,
my love is out at sean,
my love is in the ocean cause of me.
My love is in the ocean,
my love is out at sea,
my love is in the ocean cause of my.... stupidity...
