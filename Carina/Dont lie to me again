First day and I don't care no more,
what you people think cause now I know for sure.
The third day will be my last,
..I got no problem with letting go of the past.

First day and I'm all alone, sitting by the telephone.
Dont know what day it is, I just know what I miss.
Want to be myself again, who I am, cant pretend,
..really cant remember when.

Second day and I don't care what you think I cannot bear,
to care about it any more now I think I know for sure,
know that life is way to short to waste it on all these thoughts.
...got to give it all.

Ref.
Don't lie to me again,
I've got to break free from this now it is the truth I miss.
Cannot take i any more.

Oh, I cannot pretend,
pretend to be someone else, any one but myself,
now I know for sure.
