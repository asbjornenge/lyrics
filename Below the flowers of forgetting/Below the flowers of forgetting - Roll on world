Intro:

Start ganske rolig og øk gradvis tempo gjennom introen!!!

Recoring notes: Knipsing/klapping introparti før vokal i hvert vers...?

Hear the mighty chanting of the rolling waves,
sapiently careless, heading for their certain graves.
Like a million hollow people in the wind running for their caves.
A million memorable melodies mingling to the choire of the slaves.

Roll on world x3

Hear the soft silent singing of the lonely bird,
whispering those secret words only you could have heard.
Like a late night rapping, tapping on your chamber door,


while the deapths white trumpets blowing ... forevermore.

About the untamed candle of a waking soul,
with new found colors washing the canvas whole.

Roll on world x3

Times change too fast,
nothing will last.
Times change too slow,
nothing will grow.

Hear the toiling thunder and the wind,
crushing your mighty wisdom with a simple spin.
Like we leave the broken, burning battered and the beaten down,
we'll be leaft with a shred of life on the outskirts of town.

Roll on world x3
