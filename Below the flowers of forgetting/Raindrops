Intro med intenst reggen - ta opp nere i inngangen?
Litt spesi rytmar å greier oppå reggenet, litt sånn halvjam? RDY intro :P

Raindrops
--
There's raindrops on my roof,
along the lips of little daisy with truth
they collect and trickle down our drowsy stems.

There a fast wind in my face,
makes the breacrumbs in my tracks taste like disgrace,
You see I can turn my lonely toes back home anytime.

Ref.
You know I tried to reach some answers,
but answers can't be found,
they come around.
And I tried to dig for freedom,
found freedom in my mind,
from time to time.
And there ain't no wells or mountains that we can't climb. Ayah.. ( <- high pitched cowboy yodeling one from first recoring! )

Sunshine in your eyes,
those pale and milky pearls of my demise.
They spy the questions on the threshold and they cry.

Moonlinght in you hair,
the bond between us burning like a flare.
Yet another emerald for me to hide.

Ref.
You know I tried to look answers,
but answers can't be found,
they come around.
And I tried to dig for freedom,
found freedom in my mind,
from time to time.
And there ain't no wells or mountains that we can't climb.

Carri humming outro...
Lalala...
