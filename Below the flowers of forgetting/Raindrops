Raindrops
--
There's raindrops on my roof,
kissing the lips of sleepy daisies with the truth, // along the lips of little daisy and the truth
that collects and trickles down those drowsy stems.// it collects

There a fast wind in my face,
makes the breacrumbs in my tracks taste like disgrace,
You see I can turn my lonely toes back home anytime.

Ref.
You know I tried to reach some answers,
but answers can't be found,
they come around.
And I tried to dig for freedom,
found freedom in my mind,
from time to time.
And there ain't no wells or mountains that we can't climb. Ayah.. ( <- high pitched cowboy yodeling one from first recoring! )

Sunshine in your eyes,
those pale and milky pearls of my demise.
They spy a question on the threshold spelling why.

Moonbeams in you hair,
the bond between us burning like a flare.
Yet another emerald for me to hide.
