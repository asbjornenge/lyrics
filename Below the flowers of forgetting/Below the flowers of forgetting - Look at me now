Look at me now, hiding in a brand new promise,
Look at me now, all dressed and good to go.
Look at me now, head full of your spinning whispers,
Look at me now, heading for a fall...

Look at the sun, sparkling in the flakey forest,
Look at the snow, powder all around.
Look at my friends, dangling in the pillow branches,
Look at the world, spinning without sound.

FLoating down stream,
floating on your dream.

Floating to your part,
floating to your heart.

Look at your hand, hiding in my folded fingers,
Look at your smile, burnt into my mind.
Look at your toes, cold on mine on a naked morning,
Look at your day, all entagled into mine.
