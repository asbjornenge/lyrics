Once upon a time
================

* Harmonica intro *
G -> ( slide 5 barre up, same chord )
  <- G x4

G
There was once upon a time,
G
a innocent crime,
G                  C              D
but it built a few bars around my mind.

There was once upon a shoe,
innocent like you,
a little girl how got stuck in my glue.

* Drums start here *
Yeah, kick it...

* Harmonica *

When I saw her pure ( better word the pure? pale? ) and pretty face,
felt her innocent embrace,
I knew I'd found a love I never could replace.

But when she reached her pretty little hands,
into my land,
I packed my guitar-case and ran.

Ref.
Cause happiness is not my goal,
it fogs up the fairness of my soul,
whenever your near, the wind whispers clear and I glow,
won't you let me go?
b  
* Harmonica *

The universe is some kind of grand,
what would it matter if I held your hand?
But what the universe dont know,
is about you and me - and a acre by the sea down in - Mexico.
                    - in a shelter by the sea down in -
                    - eloping to -

So don't let your love fly by,
let her little wings tell you why,
whenever your near, the wind whispers clear and I glow,
woun't you let me glow?

--- sunrise --- ?
... we never know what is store.
Ohohoh <- Over kickit-biten.
