Ten long years without your lipstick love,
ten long year alone,
ten long year without your velvet voice,
on my copper wired telephone
Ten long years with this ball and chain,
ten long years away,
ten long years with a p-p-pundin' heart,
that loves you to this day.

Oh set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, with the key, with the key.
Oh, set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, coming home. Marie.

# Ver 2 bør være ting som i utgangspunktet hørres
# nice ud ang Marie, men som itte sista verset
# blir snudd heilt på hodet!

Ten long years without your black eyes cryin', // black tears drying?
blissful in my ear.
Ten long years without your gipsy rings,
braided in a prayer.
Ten long years without your whispered words,
bursting fire to the bone.
Then long years beside my brothers,
the lie, the rot and scorn.

idea - the guy proposed and her answer is "not" revealed until the last verse...

...
went down on my knee.
Ten long years without those whispered words,
bursting fire to the bone.
...

Oh set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, with the key, with the key.
Oh, set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, coming home. Marie.

What goes down it might flip around,
it might tie you in a knot.
If your bound to break a hungry (hopeless?) heart,
be sure to make it stop.
Ten long years since I dragged you down,
down my dusty cellar stairs.
Ten long years since I gagged your mouth,
and ran off dressed in tears.

Lord set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, with the key, with the key.
Lord, set me free, set me free, set me free.
I'm coming home, coming home. Marie.
