There is a sky,
blue to the naked eye.
But born on a stage,
it ain't easy to pierce the masquerade.

But the paint in your brain,
is just a cloud of contextual rain.

But behind the mash,
the skin and the skeletons ash.

There is a dream,
in every heart theres a scream,
from Cortez of Spain,
to Christ cryin' out in Getsemaneh.

But that was then this is now, somehow.


There is a life,
the sporadic spark of all strife.
* Her må det ver et godt poeng 
  som passe med sista strofå - this is then that was now 
  et eller aent time - mixed up with time, *

The chaotic throne,
it scars from the flesh to the bone.

But this is then that was now, somehow.
