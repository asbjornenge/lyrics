Emilias Lullaby
===============

Only drums on "Emilias lullaby" verses ( or only on bridge )? Guitar comes in on chorus?

Mountains and streams,
rivers and dreams,
eyes in isolation.
Don't fear life my little one.

Burning desires,
rain-cloudy skies,
laws of love and hatred,
but don't fear life my sparrow son.

Ref.
And reap what you sow and row,
as far as you can go.

Angelic wings,
a mirror that sings,
a broken promise.
Don't fear love my little one.

Complicated chemistry,
and anatomy,
a rose a ring a ribbon.
But don't fear love my sparrow son.

Ref
And reap what you sow and row,
as far as you can go.

Bridge
And if you feel your heart pounding hard,
don't worry don't be alarmed.
This is just something new,
something new for me and you, to do.

Let your final breath pass,
through a smile in the grass,
be one with all around you,
Don't fear death my little one.

A single white star,
in a glimpse from a far,
push a little further.
And don't fear life my sparrow son.

Ref.
And reap what you sow and row,
as far as you can go.
