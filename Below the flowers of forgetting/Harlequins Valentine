Harlequins Valentine - Jesus?
--

Rename: "Octobers Valentine" ?

First intro bit, long with weird rythms and sounds, trumpets and drums and voices...

New version - only one runthrough
--

Papa their piling belief on my grave,
even in death with the mark of a slave.
Mama their making a mock of my dreams,
but powerless eyes know its not what is seems.

Alone on the ocean, alone at sea.
Stearing my boat to thee.
Alone with my ideas, alone in my heart.
No more shall we be apart.

Lalala, laoooa.
Lalala, laoaoa.


Old version
--

Mama their diggin' deep in my dirt.
Mama, their lookin' under my skirt.
Mama their drillin' a hole in my brain,
but I'll never sell my soul as insane.

Alone on the ocean, alone at sea.
Stearing my boat to thee.
Alone with my ideas, alone in my heart.
No more shall we be apart.

Lalala, laoa.
Lalala, laoaoa.

Papa their building a mall on my grave,
even my bones bear the mark of a slave.
Papa their making a mock of my dreams,
but we in our heart knows its not what is seems.

Alone on the ocean, alone at sea.
Stearing my boat to thee.
Alone with my ideas, alone in my heart.
No more shall we be apart.

Lalala, laoooa.
Lalala, laoaoa.
