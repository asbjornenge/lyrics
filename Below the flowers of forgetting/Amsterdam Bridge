Amsterdam Bridge
================

Rec: Introduce a bell ( instead of the hihat over bridge og/eller andre plasser )

I left my lover on that Amsterdam bridge,
in her red carpet dress with her hair in a mess.
But walking from her something brought me to spin,
call it fate or the wind, or a voice from within.
Her sunken eyes I was unable to steal,
fixed firm on the rail, her image was pale. // her lips they were pale? were all pale now?
And leaning forward spilling tears in the stream,
undressing a dream, it was a bitter scene.

But it was never my kind on life philosophy,
for me it was all a buckling bridge of a broke philantropy.
A quiet place to hide my lies, my ripples in the sea.
But fallin' from my documents, this starving melody.

I lost my lover on that Amsterdam bridge,
in her red carpet dress, with her cross on her chest.
The shrill of trumpets froze my fumbling feet,
curtains fell in the street and half a second off beat.
There was a murmur and a kiss in a car, 
as the word Shangri-la moved the scar on her jaw.
She was lifted, I felt cold like concrete,
as I heard Lucifers feet dancing off down the street. 

Was it all a picture-stream shot on white walls in the sky,
was her cotton skin and her childhood hymn all a essence in my mind.
I cannot take that simple truth that her touch upon my face,
her rhythmic heals and the way she steals my breath is all erased.
