I wish I was a Lion,
and one that roamed alone.

Where all of the streets are covered with bone.

I wish I was an ink pen,
on fire for the cause,
I wish I werent a liar,

I wish I was on fire,
...
I wish I werent a liar.

but all of my dreams entangle a rose.

but all of my words are vague as a rose.
weak as a rose,
dim as a rose,
mimic a rose... something..

I wish I was a baby,
swinging from your hips.

Id dabble my eyes and steal me a kiss.
Youd cover my eyes and pour me a kiss.

I wish I was of concrete,
fast against the winds,
but I swing like a youngster,
...
