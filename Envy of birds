Comforting arms,
pills and needles and charms.
All these powerful words,
like a chain around my neck, could I have misheard?

Pile of questions and thoughts,
brain full of rubble that rots.
Freedom high above,
OK, I'll go, but I'll miss the love.

Envy of the birds,
Don't miss me, miss my words.
Envy of the trees,
of the songs by the wind in the summer breeze.

Pile of gold,
There is a hope in this rythm, I'm trying to hold.
I strain my aching heart,
I want to be brave, I need to be smart.
