The moon is floating by,
I've always wondered why.
It don't break free,
and fall on me.

Its all a mistery,
from the seed up to the tree top.
I head it has to do,
with gravity.

But what is gravity,
Can it make you think of me,
Does it crawl underneath the skin
of everything I see.

So keep on floating by,
we'll never stop wondering why.
And if we one day find the key
it will unlock yet another mistery.
