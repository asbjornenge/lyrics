Things unfold / things untold?
--
Go and call your mother,
call her to come home.
Then go and call another,
tell her to leave you alone.
... end all lines with unfold?

Go and sing your sister,
sing her wise and bold.
Then lay soft in silver,
bells to be unfold.

Go and roll you brother,
down a green grassy hill.
Fill his sould with laughter,
stretch it as a quill.

Go and lay your lover,
on your ... heart.
