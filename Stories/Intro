This is a story about the zani Halequin,
...
the zanni are not born from a womb like you and I,
they are born from laughter and teras, joy and misery.
But does it mean they do not exist?
They do not exists in space-time, but they do exists
without (outseide) , like the memory of an old friend or you r
gradnpa. Does he not exists? Somewhere? Can you define this place?

Did you liek what you just heard? Did you?
Well it was all bulshit.
