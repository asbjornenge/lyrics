Theres some dollars in the kitchen saying someone in the world missing love,
and the sink swells and someone yells mother take a talk up above.
She sings "you better come back to the edge of the world real soon my friend don't you know my friend".

Theres a hundred tired creatures making trailmarks trails in the forest snow,
and the wind delivers weather whispers beautiful whatevers as it blows.
She sings "I never gained a penny without a trick or twenty, there were so many men that knew me, but none like you"

Lilly ,
