Capo # 3

While cruising through the city maze, of stone and sand and lights.
I came upon a man, he gave me his hand.
Said he’d show me the land where milk and honey ran, slow.

Am I supposed to think his words is, up and right.
When his slow speech of milk and honey remain,
in the hours of the falling rain.

Would you like a cigarette, I hardly heard him say.
Now for a minute there I must have been drifting away.
Caught myself naping I heard myself say; "No thanks man, not today".

The beauty of the sidewalk, has gone away.
Just like the man it's gone in the rain,
I wonder where his land of milk and honey remain, where it is.

And I took his cruel but vague advice, I cut the ice straight.
But all the while the stairs behind me broke,
and all my courageous plans are now ashes and smoke.
I’m faithfully pinned, I’m skinned, I’m unfree.
