Dragonfly,
buzzing above the rye,
ate a butterfly,
strange as life.

Summer flake,
dabbeling in the lake,

Summer wind,
... upon the skin,

Silver lake,
a drop and a silver snake,


One missing front tooth milky white,
Two silver dollars for a kite.
Three empty bottles full of bees,
four itchy bruises on your knees.
