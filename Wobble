Wobble in my head
------------------

There's a wobbly road ahead,
there's a wobble in our waterbed.
Everything is uncertain,
everything is unclear.

But I'm not scared.

Because its all a passing time,
its all just a bubble in my mind.

Its hard to find a friend,
its even harder to keep one of them.
As tides begin to break,
your bound to find a mistake.

We're all just fake.

Because its all a passing time,
its all just a bubble in your mind.
