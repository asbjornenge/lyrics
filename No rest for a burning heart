Mangler masse...

Who are these strangers that sail in my land,
Why should I please them, I don't undertand.
...

No rest for a burning heart.

Who are these riders for right and for wrong,
who gave them horses and who made them strong.
...

No rest for a burning heart.

Like a desolate diamond you shine in my glance,
I'd bury my life to take part in your dance.
...

No rest for a burning heart.
