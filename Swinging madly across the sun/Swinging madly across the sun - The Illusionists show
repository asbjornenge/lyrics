The Illusionists show
=====================

Ah the devil's on the right track,
raining down on my parade.
lured lady luck up in a tin cup,
with the deal that he made.

With the wings of the world one day,
while I was staring down.
At an empty tin cup,
like a broken king without his... ( crown )

Four white women and a 3 pound stake,
sail Sally all around the lake.
Four white women and a 3 pound mistake.
sail Sally all around.
Talley ho, talley ho, its the Illusionists show...

Four white wishes and a 3 pound scope,
empty is the color of a hope.
Four white wistles and a 3 pound rope,
Tally hey, talley ho, its the Illusionists show...

I fought the falsity inside my heart,
onto a mountain top.
??? - something better then: ( maybe a zarathustra ref.? )
it cloared intuision in my vision,
that I can't drop.

I stumbeled back down the hill,
to proletary town.
Where I can wear my favourite costume,
and dance around... 
...with my...

Four white wishes and a narrow scope,
emty is the color of you hope.
Tally hey, talley ho, its the Illusionists show...

eller...

Four white women and a three pound stake,
sail sally all around the lake.
Four white women and a three pound stake,
sail sally all around...
Tally ho, tally ho, its the illusionist show.

Oh lord, please don't tell me!
Oh lord, please don't tell me!
Tell my mother, tell my friend,
tell my brother, tell one of them.

x2 ? With a twist at the end?

Cause I can't take, I can't breath!
I can't fake it, give me Goethe!
If this is heaven, burn my creed!?? Something of the sort...
