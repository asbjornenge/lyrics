Dark, matter eclipse the tears of a butterflies
face, draws dark dogs to the sea
side, light burns my toung and my fingertips
find, the finest line.

I, weave lights with my eyes,
I, steal fights with my sighes,
I, live lives never meant for me,
I, breath cries.

Yeah!
Am + E - hammer hard!

Steel, blades bent by the - wall of a falling leaf - rowan foliage
fell, from - a swollen silver sky - into a lit amber sky
hard, times grind my teeth and my tambourine
rings, a ring around the now ( ground? ).

Bridge: ( Hold and hammer on E during Yeah! part )
Boat on my ringside,
boat on the sea,
a boat on the river coming after me.
