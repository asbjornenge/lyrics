Chanted crying birth and dying folded in the flames,
to bits talkers thieves and stalkers hiding in their names,

I can heart strong footsteps coming down the stairs

Famous?
Folded hands clap charming rythms to fade away the skin.
of our pale and paigan purpose, the reason for our sin. ( of the pickle that we're in? - the pinnacle of sin? )
       ripe                         in the pit of our sin?

I can feel his presence like the bombing of berlin

Light the candals, fear the vandals, doom the pioneers,
to pursue the thruth of matters open up your ears.

Can you hear the thousand voices thunder near?
