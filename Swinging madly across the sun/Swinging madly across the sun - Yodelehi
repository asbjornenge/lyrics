Yodelehi
========

Cold lies in your eyes,
while Im waping.

Yodelehi, hey oh yodeley.

Dark skies when you lies,
show your weakness.

Yodelehi, hey oh yodeley.

I know you want my heartbeat around,
some men can sit and wait for the sound,
But I won't do it, I won't go through it.
But you will see it done, babe your the one.

Red roses on your cheek,
while I'm leaping 

Yodelehi, hey oh yodeley.

Dream wood falling from.
out old tree house,

Yodelehi, hey og yodeley.

The air presses hard against the ground,
raise your head fo r that black and blue sounds.
The rain is talkin, feet are blocking,         
halls around the sun, babe youre the one.
...
Barely born, babe your the one!

Men, handle ikkje om han som vil gjør det slutt eller what not suppegreier.
Hu, babe damå, har daua av overdose...
