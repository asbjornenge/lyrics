This riddle road i ride along,
Carved in fields of fabeled stoned,
With color rain that chains the sky,
Rubble ruins that dear not lie

Shaped by hands ill never shake,
Born from dreams i dear not take,
These Piles of pebble rake, ( någe marr dramatisk her? - koffor drømmane e farlige opplegg, ka de føre t..? )
These rusty chimes forsake.

There aint nowhere i gotta be,
Noone is waiting for me

There aint no rivers flowing too me,
No ships on an endless sea.
The flowers of mankind swollen and spent,
By the flames of a futile attempt
Famous event

No mans dreams i have to trace,
No mans rats i have to race,
Just me here all alone,
Whistling my way home
Humming?
