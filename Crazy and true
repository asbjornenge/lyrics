Sha was crazy and true,
amongst the beautiful few.
I opened in my door and she walked in.
She stayed for a while,
I carved her a smile.
And then her eyes met mine.

But I was uncertain,
people was hurtin'.
So were you, how could we pull through?
But I didn't know,
until she was gone.
That you souls had bound and now were one.

So I threw a coind with two tails,
... nails,
But at last I found her or she found me.

But she was now fragile,
and I felt she would break,
every time she left my bed.

So, I beg you to stay,
do not leave my way.
Let me just find a pen.

And I'll draw on your belly,
just how I feel.
Will you have my child?

My child, my child, my child...
