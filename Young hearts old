Young hearts old
--

Black lace in the good old days,
black shadows and mace.
Blue moon beneath the feddelin' tune,
staring down in your face.

Water strings under raven wings,
a wood wagon hauling your things.
Cool grass beneath the ... pass,
morning testing its wings.

Your hauling your own weight,
