Lonely boys and lank head girls
--

For all of you with buckets full of clever,
words to pin in lonely heads / homesick hearts forever.
Remerber / your landing must be lonely as a dot,
molded by a memory or not.

Calipso on a rainy rock and still,
singing of a winter gone fulfilled.
Beauty is the swinging of a day,
only found in what you cannot say.
